# üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è HackKU 2025 - SafeStep - Accessible Fall Detection

We developed SafeStep, an iOS application with a mission to improve safety and peace of mind for elderly individuals at risk of falling. Using the iPhone‚Äôs built-in motion sensors, the app detects falls in real-time and provides a simple, accessible interface for emergency contact management.

## üí° Inspiration

As our loved ones age, ensuring their safety becomes increasingly important, and falls - especially when undetected or unnoticed - can pose a significant threat to seniors. Every year, as many as [**3 million** emergency department visits are caused due to older people falling](https://www.cdc.gov/falls/data-research/facts-stats/index.html). In 2019, [83% of hip fracture deaths and 88% of emergency department visits](https://www.cdc.gov/falls/data-research/facts-stats/index.html) were due to falls, which the CDC also finds are the most common cause of traumatic brain injuries. 

Having medical alert systems in place for the people most at risk of falls can help them age with a greater sense of independence, confidence, and safety. Having free, accessible, and quickly-responsive fall detection capable of just fitting in your pocket is critical to reducing the response-time after a fall. 

Not only are falls dangerous, but the danger only increases the longer it takes to get up. Most fall cases, especially those that happen to people alone, result in 10-20 minute waits to get help - at a minimum. That can get up to as long as an hour or more, which is categorized as a 'long lie'. [**78% of individuals 65 or older** who fell required some form of help getting up from the floor, exacerbated by the fact that **over half of falls occurred with them being alone**](https://eurapa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s11556-023-00326-3 ). This extended wait can lead to any additional symptoms ranging from [dehydration and tissue damage to psychological damage](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cure/current-trials/long-lies-study#:~:text=People%20who%20have%20a%20long,for%20increasing%20periods%20of%20time).

In short, the longer people are forced to wait after a fall, the worse the situation gets. That's why we found a way to make fall detection accessible and responsive for everyone by utilizing built-in hardware in all iPhones to detect fall events and alert emergency contacts.

## :high_brightness: Innovation

- All iPhones since the iPhone 4 (2010) include a built-in triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope, capable of measuring acceleration in a 3-dimensional space
- We recorded this data going about different movements - walking, ascending and descending stairs, sitting down, lying down, and falling, and plotted the resulting acceleration data.
- Analyzing the trends in fall and non-fall events, we set a threshold to determine the occurrence of a fall event, and monitor the accelerometer data using an iPhone app to determine if a fall has occurred
- While fall detection programs have existed before, a lot of them require some kind of external hardware like Apple Watches for detection, while SafeStep just uses the iPhone's built-in technology
- Older technology like LifeAlert often require manual activation, while SafeStep's fall detection will automatically send out an alert if a fall event is not cancelled within 30 seconds of it occurring

## :lock: Challenges
- **Requesting access to permission-locked data** - Even with Apple's rigid restrictions on accessing data like contact information, location data, etc., the app very clearly walks users through and even gives them a direct shortcut to what settings to modify
- **Different acceleration data measurements** - While comparing the data gathered from HTML's DeviceMotion to the data gathered by the Swift app, we noticed a disparity in that the threshold we had found for falls did not align at all with the data in the Swift app. This took some deeper digging into the specific modules being used to find that - unbeknownst to us - one was measuring acceleration in m/s^2 and the other was measuring acceleration in multiples of the gravitational constant. While it was an easy fix, the reason behind the issue eluded us long enough to sow some doubt into whether or not our algorithm had worked correctly or not
- **Gathering data to find a good threshold for falls** - In a lot of cases, gathering data isn't necessarily the hard part of the process, especially if it's something easily automated. Gathering the acceleration data for falls, however, wasn't that simple because it required us to, well, fall
- **Accounting for other quick-acceleration movements** - While movements like walking or sitting down were easy to isolate from fall events, some things like jumping or running were more difficult to separate from falls because they both involve rapid accelerations and changes in acceleration

## :alarm_clock: What's Next
- Fully deploying the app to the Apple app store for easy installation
- Developing support for Android phones and other devices with built-in triaxial accelerometers
- Allowing for both SMS alerts and email alerts on detected falls
- Training a machine learning classifier to more accurately detect falls and not falsely get triggered on other events

## üöÄ Using the App (in its current stage)

### Requirements

- macOS with **Xcode 14+**
- iPhone running **iOS 15 or later** (fall detection requires real device sensors)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aidenhburke/hackku-25.git
cd hackku-25/frontend
open SafeStep.xcodeproj
